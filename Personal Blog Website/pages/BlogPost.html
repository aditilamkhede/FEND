            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>Marie Skłodowska Curie (born Maria Salomea Skłodowska; 7 November 1867 – 4 July 1934),
              was a Polish and naturalized-French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering
              research on radioactivity. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, is the first
              person and the only woman to win the Nobel prize twice, and is the only person to win
              the Nobel Prize in two different scientific fields. She was part of the Curie family
              legacy of five Nobel Prizes.

              Both of Curie’s parents were teachers. Her father, Wladyslaw, was a math and physics
              instructor.

            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>As a child, Curie took after her father. She had a bright and curious mind and excelled
              at school. But despite being a top student in her secondary school, Curie could not attend
              the men's-only University of Warsaw. She instead continued her education in Warsaw's
              "floating university," a set of underground, informal classes held in secret.
            </p>
            <p>Both Curie and her sister Bronya dreamed of going abroad to earn an official degree, but
              they lacked the financial resources to pay for more schooling. Undeterred, Curie worked out
              a deal with her sister: She would work to support Bronya while she was in school, and Bronya
              would return the favor after she completed her studies. For roughly five years,  Curie worked
              as a tutor and a governess. She used her spare time to study, reading about physics, chemistry
              and math.

              In 1891, Curie finally made her way to Paris and enrolled at the Sorbonne. She threw herself
              into her studies, but this dedication had a personal cost: with little money, Curie survived on
              buttered bread and tea, and her health sometimes suffered because of her poor diet.
              Curie completed her master's degree in physics in 1893 and earned another degree in mathematics
              the following year.

            <h3>Work</h3>
            <p><strong>1903 Prize:</strong> The 1896 discovery of radioactivity by Henri Becquerel inspired Marie and
              Pierre Curie to further investigate this phenomenon. They examined many substances and
              minerals for signs of radioactivity. They found that the mineral pitchblende was more
              radioactive than uranium and concluded that it must contain other radioactive substances.
               From it they managed to extract two previously unknown elements, polonium and radium,
               both more radioactive than uranium.
               </p>
               <p>
               <strong>1911 Prize:</strong> After Marie and Pierre Curie first discovered the radioactive elements
               polonium and radium, Marie continued to investigate their properties. In 1910 she
               successfully produced radium as a pure metal, which proved the new element's existence
               beyond a doubt. She also documented the properties of the radioactive elements and their
               compounds. Radioactive compounds became important as sources of radiation in both
               scientific experiments and in the field of medicine, where they are used to treat tumors.

            <h3>Honours & tributes</h3>
            <p>As one of the most famous women scientists to date, Marie Curie has become an icon in
              the scientific world and has received tributes from across the globe, even in the realm
              of pop culture.[80] In a 2009 poll carried out by New Scientist, she was voted the "most
              inspirational woman in science". Marie Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize,
              the first person to win two Nobel Prizes, the only woman to win in two fields, and the
              only person to win in multiple sciences.[87] Awards that she received include:
