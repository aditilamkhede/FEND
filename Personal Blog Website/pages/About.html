            <p>Many scholars and policymakers have noted that the fields of
              science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) have
              remained predominantly male with historically low participation
              among women since the origins of these fields during the Age of
              Enlightenment.
            </p>
            <p>Scholars are exploring the various reasons for the continued
              existence of this gender disparity in STEM fields. Those who view
              this disparity as resulting from discriminatory forces are also
              seeking ways to redress this disparity within STEM fields (these
              typically construed as well-compensated, high-status professions
              with universal career appeal).
            </p>
            <p>This blog is about women in Science, Technology, Engineering and
              Mathematics field. Womens who are role modals to coming generations.
              Womens from history to current times, how they excelled in their
              field of STEM.
            </p>
            <p>These womens are leaders in building the early foundation of modern
              programming and unveiled the structure of DNA. Their work inspired
              environmental movements and led to the discovery of new genes. They
              broke the sound barrier â€” and gender barriers along the way. And
              inspiring more young women to pursue careers in science starts with
              simply sharing their stories.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Let's honor their legacy by committing to encourage a young woman
              to pursue a career in science.</strong>
